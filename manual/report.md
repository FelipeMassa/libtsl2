# Lab Reports

Each lab report should contain the following sections:

1. Title
2. Objective
3. Description of Apparatus
    * Schematic diagram or photograph with parts descriptions
4. Procedure
5. Results & Discussion
    * Results should be presented in the form of tables and plots
6. Conclusions
7. References
8. Appendices

Lab reports may be written partially as a group. Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 may be
written entirely as a group. The results and relevant references may also be
written as a group. However, Section 6 must be written entirely individually, as
well as the discussion of results in Section 5, and any references and
appendices introduced to support individual work in Sections 5 and 6 must also
be included (by the individual).
