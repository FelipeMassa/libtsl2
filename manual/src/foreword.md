# Foreword to the 2011 Updated Annotated & Expanded Edition of ME 415: Thermal Systems Laboratory Manual

What a difference a year makes.  Instead of being subjected to the shortcomings
of ME 415, Thermal Systems Lab, I gained the responsibility of ensuring that
ME 415 ran smoothly and iterated upon itself.

This manual reflects the current state of flux that this course is in. A quick
history lesson: Dr. R. Johnson was, for many years, *the* Heat Transfer expert
in our department. At one point in time, he wrote many of the original labs and
lectured for the course. However, roughly a decade ago, he was involved in an
accident that left him in a wheelchair, and effectively unable to teach lab
courses. Dr. Bargar ended up filling the role, but merely kept the course afloat
instead of iterating upon the labs.

Last year, Dr. Johnson officially was bestowed Emeritus status, and Dr. SunWoo
Kim joined our faculty as the new Heat Transfer expert on-staff. This was his
first year teaching the course, and, like all rookie faculty members, he had
much to learn. Moreover given the state of ME 415 as of now, he had a lot of
work ahead of him.

However, even in this short period of time, Dr. Kim and I have been able to
improve on this course. We have but only began to climb the mountain that is
sufficiently improving this lab course; However, the general tone of this tome
should be more hopeful.

The 2010 edition of the Updated & Annotated manual was just as much an avenue
for me to vent as it was an effort to improve the documentation of the course.
For examples:

> Many of the procedures in the original manual are woefully outdated. Perusal
> of its contents will reveal such gems as "plot on log-log paper" (that is, by
> hand). as well as directions for using MS DOS or some unknown, archaic form of
> BASIC.

> The author insists on such practices as using a DOS laptop to access Campbell
> data-loggers, coding said data-loggers by-hand, and more. What's worse, many
> of his explanations are incomplete and, at worst, wrong.

This edition of the manual, unlike the 2010 edition, contains not just annotated
contents of the "traditional" manual and Dr. Ed Bargar's personal notes, but
also original material detailing the current status of equipment, practical
information on preparing the labs, and even some LabVIEW code where appropriate.
However, some material is not included due to lack of availability, and many of the
directions contained in this lab manual are still out-of-date.

As I said in the 2010 foreword, "This edition of the Thermal Systems Laboratory
Manual is not intended to be complete, well-organized or even professional.
However, with luck, it will be more useful." This is true now more than ever.
