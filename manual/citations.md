# Citation Guidelines

## Text Citation:

Within the text, references should be cited in numerical order according to
their order of appearance. The numbered reference citation should be enclosed in
brackets.

## Example:

    It was shown by Prusa [1] that the width of the plume decreases under these
    conditions.

In the case of two citations, the numbers should be separated by a comma [1,2].
In the case of more than two reference citations, the numbers should be
separated by a dash [5-7].

## List of References:

References to original sources for cited material should be listed together at the end of the paper; footnotes should not be used for this purpose. References should be arranged in numerical order according to their order of appearance within the text. 

1. Reference to journal articles and papers in serial publications should
include:
    * last name of each author followed by their initials
    * year of publication
    * full title of the cited article in quotes, title capitalization
    * full name of the publication in which it appears
    * volume number (if any) in boldface (Do not include the abbreviation, "Vol.")
    * issue number (if any) in parentheses (Do not include the abbreviation, “No.”)
    * inclusive page numbers of the cited article (include “pp.”) 

2. Reference to textbooks and monographs should include:
    * last name of each author followed by their initials
    * year of publication
    * full title of the publication in italics
    * publisher
    * city of publication
    * inclusive page numbers of the work being cited (include “pp.”r )
    * chapter number (if any) at the end of the citation following the abbreviation, “Chap.”

3. Reference to individual conference papers, papers in compiled conference proceedings, or any other collection of works by numerous authors should include:
    * last name of each author followed by their initials
    * year of publication
    * full title of the cited paper in quotes, title capitalization
    * individual paper number (if any)
    * full title of the publication in italics
    * initials followed by last name of editors (if any), followed by the abbreviation, “eds.”
    * publisher
    * city of publication
    * volume number (if any) in boldface if a single number, include, “Vol.” if part of larger identifier (e.g., “PVP-Vol. 254”) 
    * inclusive page numbers of the work being cited (include “pp.”b )

4. Reference to theses and technical reports should include:
    * last name of each author followed by their initials
