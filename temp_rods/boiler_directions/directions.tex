The boiler, conceptually, is actually quite simple. It uses electric heating elements to boil water. Water is supplied with a hose, and hot steam comes out.

The water level is controlled by what is labelled as the ``water level control'' in Figure \ref{fig:boiler}. Think of it kinda like a toilet float.
